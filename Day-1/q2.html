        <h1>var, let, and const</h1>
        <p>JavaScript variables can be declared via the <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> keywords. The latter two were introduced into the language with ES6</p>
        <p><code>var</code>: Variables declared with <code>var</code> are global in scope. They can be declared anywhere in the code, and they can be re-declared, as well as their values can be modified.</p>
        <p><code>let</code>: Variables declared with <code>let</code> have a block scope, (i.e., code enclosed in braces {}). Like with <code>var</code>, their value can be modified, but the variables cannot be redeclared within the same scope, and trying to do so will generate an error.</p>
        <p><code>const</code>: Variables declared with <code>const</code> also have a block scope. In addition, they can neither be redeclared, nor can their values be modified.</p>

                <td>var</td>
                <td>Global</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>let</td>
                <td>Block</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>Yes</td>
            </tr><tr>
                <td>const</td>
                <td>Block</td>
                <td>No</td>
                <td>No</td>

        <p>The sample JavaScript code in this file illustrates these different types of variable declarations (check console for output).</p>

        <script>
            var a = "Hello";    // A var declaration
            let b = "Hi";       // A let declaration
            console.log("a: ", a);
            console.log("b: ", b);

            // Start of a code block
            {
                console.info("Declaration within a block")   
                var a = "Hello again";  // Redeclaration of globally scoped variable a
                let b = "Hi again";     // Declaration of variable b in a block scope 
                console.log("a: ", a);
                console.log("b: ", b);
            }

            console.info("Globally scoped variables")
            console.log("a: ", a); // As a has global scope, redeclaration within the block has changed its value
            console.log("b: ", b); // As b has block scope, The variable declared outside the block is independent of the one declared within

            const c = "I cannot be changed";    // A constant variable declration
            console.log("c: ", c);
            c = "Changed constant"              // This will generate an assignment error
        </script>
